# Lesekaters Homebrew Tap

Crudely made Homebrew Tap for tools that I need myself. I probably wouldn't recommend this tap to others ;D

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install lesekater/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap lesekater/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "lesekater/tap"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
